I am a senior **Computer Science** and **History** student. I have experience as a web developer and I am expanding my knowledge in both back-end and front-end development. My goal is to do more projects from the ground up 
- 🤍 I’m currently learning ...
  - *Computer Vision* 
  - *Django*
  - *GLSL*
- 🧚 Looking for open source projects to contribute to! 
- Outside tech, I enjoy hanging out with friends, playing video games (persona 3 reloaded!!), listening to music, and watching movies 🥰.
